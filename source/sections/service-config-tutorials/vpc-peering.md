### VPC Peering with the CKS VPC
Some applications require additional AWS resources beyond what is provisioned with CKS. For example, your application might store data in RDS. To maintain logical separation between Datica-managed resources and resources you manage, it is best to provision these resources in a separate VPC, then create a peering connection between the two VPCs. 

VPC peering with CKS works just like any other VPC peering. You can follow the instructions in [Amazon's guide for creating a VPC peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html). You may add routes to the route tables created for CKS or attach additional security groups and rules to instances as needed.
