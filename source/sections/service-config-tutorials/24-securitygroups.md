### Security Group Rule Changes
There are certain scenarios where services you deploy require changes to Security Group rules in order to function appropriately. By default, Datica includes set of Security Groups with an initial set of rules to enable the cluster and resources to function. For managing changes to the overall Security Group rules, we suggest creating a new Security Group with the specific rules you need. Having a separate group will make it easier for you to distinguish between manual changes you have made and the rules that Datica set up and manages.

While we suggest creating your own Security Group for managing new rules, if changes to Datica's Security Groups are made, the following situations apply: any rules you add to Datica's Security Groups will persist, but any changes to rules that Datica sets up by default will NOT persist.
