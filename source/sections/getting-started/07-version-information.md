### CKS versioning policy
Datica addresses vulnerabilities and security issues as they become publicly available. Kubernetes upgrades and deployment tooling updates happen on a quarterly basis (unless a security liability is present, in which case we would update as soon as possible). Below is a list of the current versions of software we run:

- CoreOS: 1967.6.0
