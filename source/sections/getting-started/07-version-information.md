### CKS versioning policy
Datica addresses vulnerabilities and security issues as they become publicly available. Kubernetes upgrades and deployment tooling updates happen on a quarterly basis (unless a security liability is present, in which case we would update as soon as possible). Below is a list of the current versions of software we run:

- CoreOS:
- Kubernetes:
- Falco:
- Prometheus:
- Elasticsearch:
- FluentD:
- Kibana:
- CclamAV:
- CRI-O:
- Flannel:
