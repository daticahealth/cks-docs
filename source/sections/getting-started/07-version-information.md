### CKS versioning policy
Datica addresses vulnerabilities and security issues as they become publicly available. Kubernetes upgrades and deployment tooling updates happen on a quarterly basis (unless a security liability is present, in which case we would update as soon as possible). Below is a list of the current versions of software we run:

- CoreOS: 1688.5.3
- Kubernetes: 1.11.5
- etcd: 3.2.18
