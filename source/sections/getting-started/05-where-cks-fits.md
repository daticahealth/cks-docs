### Where CKS fits

If you're new to Datica, CKS will be home to all applications that store or transmit sensitive information, like PII or PHI. Because Datica is aligned with HITRUST, customers can take advantage of global deployments and rest easy knowing they're covered for localized compliance regimes like GDPR, IRAP and more. We're also constantly adding support for new compliance frameworks, [for more information see our compliance roadmap here](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/global/).

If you're an existing Datica user and not already using our Kubernetes service, please be aware that eventually CKS will replace Datica's Legacy Platform product. We're working toward having every customer migrate by January 2019. This is a loose deadline and will evolve and shift based on the needs of our customers. As for Datica's Managed Integration service, this will remain as is for the foreseeable future. We don't currently have any plans to migrate integration customers. If those plans change we will make an official announcement and contact each customer individually.

We're hopeful about the future of Kubernetes and cloud native applications. This shift aligns with demand from our customers to allow for more flexibility within Datica's product offering. As an organization we are committed to helping the cloud native community grow through adoption and a commitment to open source software.

If you have any questions, comments or feedback about our shift to CKS, please email us directly at [product@datica.com](mailto:product@datica.com).
