### Expectations

Throughout the rest of the getting started guide we'll walk you through:

- How to learn Kubernetes with a curated list of resources
- How to request a CKS cluster
- How to access your new cluster
- How to access Datica managed deployments
- Understanding the shared responsibility model

Beyond this getting started guide, we also have resources for [architecting](TODO) your applications as well as [pricing](TODO) and [migration](TODO) information.
