### Compliance Monitoring

#### Intrusion Detection

Datica's CKS includes a [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) deployment for intrusion detection. It is configured to alert Datica's security team, which triggers an internal process for evaluating and addressing events, including customer escalation if necessary.

#### Vulnerability Scanning
Datica performs external vulnerability scanning for all production CKS clusters. Daticaâ€™s security team keeps track of alerts generated by Nessus and has protocols for evaluating and addressing events that occur, including a customer escalation protocol for application-specific events.
