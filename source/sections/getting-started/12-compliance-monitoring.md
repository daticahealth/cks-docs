### Compliance Monitoring

#### Intrusion Detection

Datica's CKS includes a [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) deployment for intrusion detection. It is configured to alert Datica's security team, which triggers an internal process for evaluating and addressing events, including customer escalation if necessary.

#### Vulnerability Scanning
Datica performs external vulnerability scanning for all production CKS clusters. Daticaâ€™s security team keeps track of alerts generated by Nessus and has protocols for evaluating and addressing events that occur, including a customer escalation protocol for application-specific events.

#### Volume Snapshots
Datica creates daily snapshots of all volumes attached to instances in your CKS cluster. These snapshots are kept for a minimum of two days, and are replicated across regions for redundancy. Snapshots older than two days are pruned automatically. These snapshots are intended for maintaining compliance, not for data recovery. As such, Datica does not guarantee that data recovery using these snapshots will work with your particular use case. We recommend customers use other methods, frequencies, and retention policies for data recovery if such functionality is desired.
