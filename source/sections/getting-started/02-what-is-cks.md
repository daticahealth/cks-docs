### What is CKS?

Everyone is excited about Kubernetes, [including us](https://datica.com/blog/datica's-gone-native-cloud-native/)! Datica is proud to offer a secure, compliant Kubernetes managed service with CKS.

CKS stands for "Compliant Kubernetes Service". CKS is a managed Kubernetes service — a service that can be defined in a number of different ways. In the most basic form, a managed Kubernetes service assumes management of the control plane, a group of controllers that take care of routine tasks to ensure the desired state of the cluster matches the observed state. Because Kubernetes can be configured and deployed in a number of different ways, users are often confused about how to setup and manage a Kubernetes cluster.

It is because of this problem that managed Kubernetes service providers exist. The biggest players in this space are the three large cloud providers, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. As Kubernetes adoption increases, so too is the need for a secure, compliant version of Kubernetes.

Although AWS's Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) product recently became eligible for HIPAA compliance, that doesn't necessarily mean it _is_ compliant. In order to ensure a cluster is defensibly compliant, a user would have to develop a clear definition of everything the product does to ensure compliance (in a signed legal agreement) as well as have a BAA in place with the service provider. The only other option is for the user to be responsible for the configuration of the underlying cluster, the operating system that runs the cluster and the instances (servers) the operating systems lives on.

The big cloud providers will provide sufficient descriptions of their product and possibly even sign a BAA, but gaps remain. Configuring logging, monitoring, intrusion detection, networking, an operating system, as well as a whole slew of infrastructure level configurations defeats the purpose of a managed service — the primary benefit of which is that a customer doesn't have to worry about the aforementioned components or their intended configurations.

**If you're working within a regulated industry like healthcare you have almost zero efficient options when it comes to using Kubernetes — either you manage the Kubernetes control plane, the operating system and the underlying infrastructure to maintain the flexibility required for compliance, or you risk falling out of compliance by using a managed service (because they don't provide the configuration flexibility to achieve compliance).**

This is where CKS comes in. In addition to managing the control plane, Datica also configures the underlying operating system (and manages it in perpetuity), configures the underlying instances — and installs, configures and manages a set of deployments required for compliance. These deployments include logging, monitoring, intrusion detection and antivirus software. In addition to the technical configuration, Datica assumes the liability for the complete stack in our BAA, something not available or possible with any other managed Kubernetes offering. CKS delivers a compliant managed Kubernetes service that functions like any other Kubernetes cluster, but one that comes pre-configured for compliance out of the box.
