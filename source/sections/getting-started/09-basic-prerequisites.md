### Basic prerequisites

Once you've [established contact](https://datica.com/contact) with Datica, the first step is to work with our sales department on understanding your organization's needs as they pertain to compliance and security in the cloud. This will likely require a few in depth discussions as well as a technical overview of CKS.

From there, we'll put together a contract based on these conversations. Once the contract is signed by both parties, Datica will schedule the provisioning of your new CKS cluster. Because CKS is still a new offering, we require 3-5 days of lead time. Once you're in the queue, our services team will establish contact with your organization and securely request a set of information via a secure form that will be shared with you.
