### Basic prerequisites

Once you've [established contact](https://datica.com/contact) with Datica, the first step is to work with our sales department on understanding your organization's needs as they pertain to compliance and security in the cloud. This will likely require a few in depth discussions as well as a technical overview of CKS.

After you've purchased CKS, Datica will provide you with a set of pre-requisite activities and detailed instructions for provisioning your CKS clusters. Clusters are typically provisioned 3-5 business days following the completion of your provisioning request.
