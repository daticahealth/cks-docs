### Where CKS fits

If you're new to Datica, CKS will be home to all applications that store or transmit sensitive information, like PII or PHI. Because Datica is aligned with HITRUST, customers can take advantage of global deployments and rest easy knowing they're covered for localized compliance regimes like GDPR, IRAP and more. We're also constantly adding support for new compliance frameworks, [for more information see our compliance roadmap here](https://datica.com/compliance/global/).

We're hopeful about the future of Kubernetes and cloud native applications. Our efforts to build CKS align with demand from our customers to allow for more flexibility within Datica's product offering. As an organization we are committed to helping the cloud native community grow through adoption and a commitment to open source software.
