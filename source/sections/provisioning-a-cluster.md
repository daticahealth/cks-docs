## Provisioning a cluster

The primary benefit of using Datica is that we manage compliance and security for you. The secondary benefit is that we're a fully managed Kubernetes service. This means you simply tell us what you need (via the information collected above) and we take care of the rest. Our automated configuration tooling will stand up the cluster, compliance deployments, and the underlying infrastructure in a matter of minutes.
